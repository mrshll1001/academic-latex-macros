% Designed for my use, but decided to make it public.

%% GENERAL USE %%  
\newcommand{\quoteit}[1]{\textit{``#1''}} % Quote inline simply, automatically adds speech marks and makes it italic.

\newcommand{\note}[1]{\textcolor{blue}{(\textbf{#1})}} % Brackets the contents, makes blue and bold. I use it to add notes to fieldwork diaries to follow up on later.

\newcommand{\bollocks}[1]{\textcolor{red}{\uppercase{#1}}} % Highlights the err, filler, in a document that you want to come back to later

%% TRANSCRIPTS %%
\newcommand{\crosstalk}[1]{\{#1\}}
