# academic-latex-macros
Evolving set of macros I've found useful for quickly formatting text when writing academic documents in LaTeX.

## Installation and Usage
Just copy and paste into your LaTeX folder and `\usepackage{academicmacros}`

## Included macros
There aren't many yet.

`\quoteit{}` Designed for quoting inline. Turns contents italic and wraps it in quotation marks so `\quoteit{Some really good insight}` become *"Some really good insight"*

`\bollocks{}` Designed for remembering when you've put in some filler in order to keep up pace but need to return to this in the future. Makes this text all caps, and red.
